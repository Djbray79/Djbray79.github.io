            <h3 class="biot">Bio:</h3>

            <p class="bio">I was born in 1979, graduated high school in 1998 and studied computer repair in high school. I studied programming back in high school, but have not touched it in more than a few years.
                I am now in Code Louisville learning to program again, and all the new langueges and advancements that have come along while I was away.
                I am looking forward to seeing where this path takes me, and getting back into programming.
