<h2>My portfolio</h2>
<p>This portfolio will be a way for me to showcase my current and future coding projects that display my skills, and abilities. It currently has a welcome button to click on that asks a question then displays a greeting, an image carousel of my family and I, and links to my email, GitHub and LinkedIn accounts.
<li>Please load index.html and explore my portfolio.</li></p>
<p>If you have any sugestions or notice any issues, please feel free to share them with me.</p>
